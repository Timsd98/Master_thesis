This repository containes two files:

1.   Categorizing_enriched_proteins_final.ipynb - which is used for querying the dataset (with log_2 > 0) with UniProt, thus determining the localization of the proteins
2.   automatized_BLAST.ipynb - which is the code used for accessing BLAST via its API using NCBIWWW and consequently automatically querying the proteins in the dataset
